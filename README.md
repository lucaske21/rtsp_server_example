# RTSP Server

This repository contains the code for an RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) server. The RTSP server allows clients to establish and control media sessions for streaming audio and video content. It provides a reliable and efficient way to transmit real-time multimedia data over IP networks.

## Features

- Support for RTSP protocol version 1.0
- Ability to handle multiple concurrent client connections
- Support for various media formats, including audio and video
- Flexible configuration options for customization
- Robust error handling and logging mechanisms

## Getting Started

To get started with the RTSP server, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Configure the server settings according to your requirements.
4. Build and run the server.
5. Connect your RTSP client to the server and start streaming media.

For detailed instructions, please refer to the [documentation](/d:/playground/rtsp_server/README.md).

## Setting up the virtual environment with conda
To set up the environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Conda**: If you haven't installed Conda yet, you can download it from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). Choose the version that suits your operating system.

2. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**: Open your terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows).

3. **Create a new Conda environment**: Use the following command to create a new Conda environment. Replace `myenv_rtsp` with the name you want to give to your environment, and `3.9` with the Python version you want to use.

    ```bash
    conda create --name myenv_rtsp python=3.9
    ```

4. **Activate the environment**: Use the following command to activate the environment you just created.

    ```bash
    conda activate myenv_rtsp
    ```

5. **Install packages**: Now you can install packages in your environment using `conda install` or `pip install`. For example, to install numpy, you would use:

    ```bash
    conda install numpy
    ```

6. **Deactivate the environment**: When you're done working in your environment, you can deactivate it with:

    ```bash
    conda deactivate
    ```

Remember, whenever you want to work with this environment, you need to activate it first with `conda activate myenv_rtsp`.
